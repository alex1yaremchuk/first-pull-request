# First Pull Request

Welcome to the First Pull Request! 
This repository is a sandbox for new developers to practice their first pull requests and participation in (contribution to) an open-source project.

## Overview

This project was born when I decided that I want to participate in some OS project, but was a bit scared by real ones, even those marked as being friendly to newcomers.

I decided to make a dedicated GitHub repo which will always have a toy issue and which will welcome pull requests. 

## Features

- Practice forking and cloning repos
- Practice on making some changes to the codebase
- Optionally practice with running unit tests
- Practice creating pull requests
- Check out the results of CI with linting and testing
- See your PR being accepted 
- See the results of your work on <a href="https://alex1yaremchuk.github.io/first-pull-request/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github.io pages</a>.
- See your name among contributors!

## Getting Started: Code-free part

Simplest way of contributing to this project would be to modify the text file text/changeme.md. 
It won't demand running any tests or checks and there is no automatic filter for changes (at least for now).
Even issue is not created for the changes. 

To check results of your merged pull request see <a href="https://github.com/alex1yaremchuk/first-pull-request/blob/main/text/changeme.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">text/changeme.md</a> file in the this repo.

Please refer to [step-by-step instruction](CONTRIBUTING-LIGHT.md) if you need it.

## Getting Started: Code-amending part

If you're ready to fix a bug in simplest javascript code, this section is for you.
The code in action can be seen <a href="https://alex1yaremchuk.github.io/first-pull-request/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

if it shows an incorrect result, an issue may already exist in <a href="https://github.com/alex1yaremchuk/first-pull-request/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Issues</a>. Feel free to claim it and go on with fixing. 

Please refer to [step-by-step instruction](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you need it.

When claiming the issue you can **optionally** ask for 
- **Additional change request**  
  I'll return you the pull request asking to add comments.
  You'll then add a new commit and resolve the comment.
- **Merge conflict**  
  I'll check a conflicting change in before your pull request. 
  You'll have to pull the latest changes from the upstream repo (this one) and then add a resulting merge commit to your pull request. 
  For detailed commands refer to last section in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
